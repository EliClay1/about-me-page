    <h1 class="title">So Who the Heck is Eli Clayson?</h1>
    <hr>
    <div class="p-div">
        <p><i>Many think that Eli Clayson is a vast adventurer, one who braves new planets, and changes the world. </i> Unfortunately, the truth is much <i>much</i> farther from that. So let me introduce you to a semi-wonderful person who likes pizza and video editing...</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2 class="title">Hobbies? Never heard of em...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Videography (my current job)</li>
        <li>Game Modding (working on a minecraft mod right now)</li>
        <li>Insert third thing here</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="p-div">
        <p>My hobbies kind of range, and they definitely shift around rather frequently. Currently I am helping create a community operated minecraft movie, so we'll see how that goes... From philosophy to astrology, my interests are constantly shifting around left, right, and center. I love learning new things, so this list is basically always changing.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="title">Mi Familia</h2>
    <div class="p-div">
        <p>My family is rather disfunctional, but what modern day family isn't? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Regardless of that lovely information, here's the roster!</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Padre - Scott </li>
        <li>Madre - Alisha </li>
        <li>Sister - Celeste </li>
        <li>Brother 1 - Josh</li>
        <li>Brother 2 - Aaron</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yep, that is pretty much all you get to know about my family. Moving on!</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="title">Educationer? I hardly know her!</h2>
    <div class="p-div">
